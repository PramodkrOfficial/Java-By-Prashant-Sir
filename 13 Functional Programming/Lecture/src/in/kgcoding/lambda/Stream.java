<-------------------------------------------------{'Using "Stream under to Lambda" in deep learning'}------------------------------------------------------------->

1. Element Sequence: Streams represent a sequence of elements.
2. Functional Operations: Operations like map, filter, and reduce.
3. No Storage: Streams don't store data, they process it on-the-fly from sources like collections or arrays.
4. Efficiency: Stream operations can be lazy, processing elements only as needed, which is efficient for large data,
5. One-Time Use: Streams are consumable; once processed, they cannot be.
6. Parallel Capable: They support parallel processing, making operations faster by utilizing multiple threads.
