                                                 Imperative Programming                          |                        Declarative Programming

1. Computation                | You describe the step-by-step instructions for how               | You set the conditions that trigger the program execution to produce
                              | an executed program achieves the desired results.                | the desired results.
                              |                                                                  |
                              |                                                                  |
                              |                                                                  |
2. Readability and Complexity | With the emphasis on the control flow, you can often follow the  | Step-be-step processes are eschewed. You'll discover that this paradigm
                              | step-by-step process fairly easily. However, as you add more     | is less complex and requires less code, making it easier to read.
                              | code, it can become longer and more complex.                     |
                              |                                                                  |
                              |                                                                  |
3. Customization              | A straightforward way to customize and edit code and structure   | Customizing the source code is more difficult because of complicated
                              | is offered. You have complete control and can easily adapt the   | syntax and the paradigm's dependence on implementing a pre-configured
                              | structure of your program to your needs.                         | algorithm.
                              |                                                                  |
                              |                                                                  |
4. Optimization               | Adding extensions and making upgrades are supported, but doing   | You can easily optimize code because an algorithm controls the
                              | so is significantly more challenging than with declarative       | implementation. Further more you can add extensions and make upgrades.
                              | programming, making it harder to optimize.                       |                                          |
                              |                                                                  |
                              |                                                                  |
5. Structure                  | The code structure can be long and complex. The code itself      | The code structure is concise and precise, and it lacks detail.
                              | specifies how it should run and in what order.                   |                                               |
                              |                                                                  |
                              |                                                                  |
