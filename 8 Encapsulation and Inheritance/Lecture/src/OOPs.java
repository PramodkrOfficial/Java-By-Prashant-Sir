<-----------------------------------------------{"Using OPPs Principle in Deep"}------------------------------------------------------------>

Definition:---------> OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) in Java is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects.
                      Think of objects as real-world entities like cars, phones, or people. Each object has properties
                      (like color or age) and behaviors (like driving or calling).
                      These objects are instances of classes, which define their properties (attributes) and behaviors
                      (methods). OOP principles help us design and structure our code in a way that is modular, reusable, and maintainable.

Features:-----------> Modularity: Code is organized into reusable components.
                      Reusability: Reduces code duplication and promotes efficient development.
                      Maintainability: Code is easier to understand, modify, and debug.
                      Extensibility: New features can be added without affecting existing code.
                      Flexibility: Code can adapt to changing requirements.
Key OOPs Concepts:--> Class: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors that objects of that class will have.
                      Object: An instance of a class. It has its own specific values for the properties defined in the class.
                      Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on the essential features of an object, hiding unnecessary details.
                                   It allows us to model real-world entities in a simplified way.
                      Inheritance: The ability of one class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.
                                   This promotes code reuse.
                      Encapsulation: The bundling of data (properties) and methods (behaviors) within a single unit (class).
                                     This helps protect data integrity.
                      Polymorphism: The ability of objects to take on many forms. It allows objects of different types
                                    to be treated as if they were of the same type.

Why used OOPs:------> Encapsulation: when an object only exposes the selected information.
                      Abstraction: Hides complex details to reduce complexity.
                      Inheritance: Entities can inherit attributes from other entities.
                      Polymorphism: Entities can have more than one form.

1. Encapsulation:---> Definition: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate
                                  on that data within a single unit, the class.

   Why Use It:------> Data Hiding: Protects data integrity by restricting direct access to it.
                      Modularity: Enhances code organization and reduces complexity.
                      Reusability: Promotes code reuse by creating self-contained units.

2. Abstraction:-----> Definition: Abstraction focuses on the essential features of an object, hiding unnecessary details.
                                  It allows us to model real-world entities in a simplified way.

   Why Use It:------> Simplicity: Reduces complexity by focusing on relevant aspects.
                      Code Readability: Improves code clarity and maintainability.
                      Interface Design: Defines a contract for classes to implement, promoting loose coupling.

3. Inheritance:-----> Definition: Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class (subclass or child class) inherits the
                                  properties and methods of another class (superclass or parent class).

   Why Use It:------> Code Reusability: Reduces code duplication by inheriting common functionalities.
                      Polymorphism: Enables creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.

4. Polymorphism:----> Definition: Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects to take on many forms. It allows objects
                                  of different types to be treated as if they were of the same type.

   Why Use It:------> Flexibility: Makes code more adaptable to different situations.
                      Method Overloading: Defines multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
                      Method Overriding: Redefines a method in a subclass to provide a specific implementation.
