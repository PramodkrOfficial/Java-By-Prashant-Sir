/*
<-------------------------------------------------------------{"Using 'FileWriter' keyword in deep"}---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
1. FileWriter is used for writing streams of characters to files.
2. It's a character-based stream, which means it's best used for writing text rather than binary data.
3. Constructors:
            FileWriter(String fileName): Creates a FileWriter object given the name of the file to write to.
            FileWriter(File file): Creates a FileWriter object given a File object.
4. Common Methods:
            write(int c): Writes a single character.
            write(char[] cbuf):Writes an array of characters.
            write(String str): Writes a string.
            flush(): Flushes the stream, ensuring all data is written out.
            close(): Closes the stream, releasing any associated system resources.
